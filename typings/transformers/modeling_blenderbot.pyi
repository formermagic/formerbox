    This model inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel`. Check the superclass documentation for the generic
    methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings,
    pruning heads etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module>`__ subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general
    usage and behavior.
