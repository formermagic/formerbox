This script can be used to convert a head-less TF2.x Bert model to PyTorch,
as published on the official GitHub: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/nlp/bert

TF2.x uses different variable names from the original BERT (TF 1.4) implementation.
The script re-maps the TF2.x Bert weight names to the original names, so the model can be imported with Huggingface/transformer.

You may adapt this script to include classification/MLM/NSP/etc. heads.
