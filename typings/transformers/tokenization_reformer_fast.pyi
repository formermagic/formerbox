    Construct a "fast" Reformer tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's `tokenizers` library). Based on `SentencePiece
    <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>`__ .

    This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast` which contains most of the main
    methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (:obj:`str`):
            `SentencePiece <https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>`__ file (generally has a `.spm` extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        eos_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            .. note::

                When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end
                of sequence. The token used is the :obj:`sep_token`.
        unk_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (:obj:`str`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        additional_special_tokens (:obj:`List[str]`, `optional`):
            Additional special tokens used by the tokenizer.
